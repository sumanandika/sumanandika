# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Project

Heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, is a significant health concern globally, contributing to a large number of fatalities every year. This project aims to analyze a dataset related to cardiovascular health and develop a predictive model for heart disease detection using machine learning techniques.

## Introduction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with estimates suggesting that it accounts for 28.1% of fatalities. Given its severity, there is a pressing need for accurate and dependable systems to predict, diagnose, and treat cardiovascular diseases promptly. This project seeks to contribute to this effort by leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze a dataset containing various factors associated with heart attacks.

## Project Output Instructions
1. **Data Pre-processing**: Perform data pre-processing operations to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. **Data Analysis and Visualizations**: Utilize various plots and visualizations to derive insights and understand the relationships between different variables in the dataset.
3. **Correlation Matrix**: Display the correlation matrix of features to identify relationships between variables.
4. **Accuracy Levels of Machine Learning Techniques**: Evaluate the accuracy levels of different machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF).
5. **Machine Learning Model Building**: Build a machine learning model for heart disease detection based on the dataset and the results obtained from evaluating various techniques.
